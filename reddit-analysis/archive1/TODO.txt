1.  Make a database pipeline from reddit to my local PC
2. Find a way to pipe DB data back to my ML script
3. Write SQL to transform and clean data to make ML ready (author data priority)
     -Iron out author data points: PPD, Post volume per subreddit, PPD per subreddit, publisher diversity, publisher diversity by subreddit?, subreddit combinations?
     -Is it possible to run ML on title content? Like, ML based on common engrams (this might be too biased)
4. Run and Tune ML - while prioritising a way to confirm class predictions
5. Run NP engrams on ML classes

Clean repo and Post to github
Automate and fincify all this in AWS with chris's help
6. Pipe findings into JS vizualisations & build app
